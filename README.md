# ThisThenThat

Turn any assignment into a clear, step-by-step game plan.

## What is it?

ThisThenThat takes a PDF of your school or university assignment and breaks it down into an ordered checklist of actionable steps. No more staring at a 5-page assignment brief wondering where to start — just upload and go.

Each step also has its own AI chat. Stuck on "find three peer-reviewed sources"? Click the step, ask a question, and get advice that actually knows your assignment.

## How it works

1. **Upload your assignment PDF** — the AI reads it and generates 5-15 concrete steps
2. **Work through the checklist** — check off steps as you go, track your progress
3. **Ask for help on any step** — click a step to open a chat that understands your full assignment and where you're at

## What it won't do

- It won't write your assignment for you
- It won't accept random PDFs — only actual assignments (it'll tell you if something isn't one)
- It won't store your PDF file — just the text content for AI context
